# omninim v.0.5.0 - Nim v.1.4.8

Patched version of the Nim compiler in order to be embedded within the Omni audio DSL.

## Notes:

All additional code is prepended with the `#OMNI` comment.

## Additions:

1) On failed compilation, it does not `quit`, but it uses `setjmp` and `longjmp` to implement a low-level
`try` / `catch` mechanism. Check the `compiler/omni/omni_nim_compiler.nim` folder for the implementation of the `omniNimCompile` function.

2) Disabled `stdin` handling. All `conf` settings need to be manually assigned via code. 

3) Disabled `stdout` and `stderr` handling. The output of compilation is assigned to the
`conf.compilationOutput` variable.

4) Disabled the need for `-d:selftest`, which would run the compiler cmd line interface in
`compiler/nim.nim`.
